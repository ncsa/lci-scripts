## SSH keys for passwordless SSH

# As root on login node
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh
touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# As root on each compute node/storage node
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh

# As root on the login node
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-compute-XX-1:/root/.ssh
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-compute-XX-2:/root/.ssh
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-storage-XX-1:/root/.ssh

## Parallel Shell
# On your head node for this section
dnf install clustershell

# Add the following to the /etc/clustershell/groups.d/local.cfg file (replace the example stuff)
head: lci-head-XX-1
compute: lci-compute-XX-[1-2]
login: lci-head-XX-1
storage: lci-storage-XX-1
all: lci-storage-XX-1 lci-compute-XX-[1-2]

# Test it out
clush -g compute "uptime"

## Time Sync
dnf install chrony
#confirm config file meets expectation
systemctl start chronyd && systemctl enable chronyd

# Point compute and storage nodes to head node chrony server using clush. 
# Replace $head_node_ip with the ip of the head node. Find using 'ip a' on head node
clush -ab "dnf install -y chrony"
clush -ab "echo 'server $head_node_ip iburst' | sudo tee -a /etc/chrony.conf"
clush -ab "systemctl restart chronyd"

# Verify nodes have lci-head-xx-1 in chrony sources list
clush -ab chronyc sources

## Central Logging

# Remove comments for following lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf on lci-head-XX-1
module(load="imudp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imudp" port="514")

module(load="imtcp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imtcp" port="514")

# Add these two lines in the Modules section:
$template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/forwarded-logs.log"
*.* -?DynamicFile

# Restart rsyslog on head node
systemctl restart rsyslog

# Add following to the very bottom of /etc/rsyslog.conf on both compute nodes/storage node and restart rsyslog service on those nodes
*.* @lci-head-XX-1
systemctl restart rsyslog

# After a few minutes you should see new log directories in /var/log/ on lci-head-XX-1, a directory for each host forarding logs
ls /var/log/messaegs/lci-[computes/storage]-XX-Y/
