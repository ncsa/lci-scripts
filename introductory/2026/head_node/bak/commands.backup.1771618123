# On your head node for this section - as root
dnf install clustershell

# Add the following to the /etc/clustershell/groups.d/local.cfg file (replace the example stuff)
head: lci-head-XX-1
compute: lci-compute-XX-[1-2]
login: lci-head-XX-1

## Central Logging
# Remove comments for following lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf on lci-head-XX-1
module(load="imudp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imudp" port="514")

module(load="imtcp") # needs to be done just once
input(type="imtcp" port="514")

# Add these two lines in the Modules section:
$template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/forwarded-logs.log"

# Restart rsyslog on head node
systemctl restart rsyslog

# Add following to the very bottom of /etc/rsyslog.conf on both compute nodes/storage node and restart rsyslog service on those nodes
*.* @lci-head-XX-1
systemctl restart rsyslog

# After a few minutes you should see new log directories in /var/log/ on lci-head-XX-1, a directory for each host forarding logs
ls /var/log/lci-[computes/storage]-XX-Y/
